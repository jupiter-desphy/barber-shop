# Tabor Barber Shop

I developed this website for a local fourth-generation son and pop barbershop in Portland, Oregon from design to completion. Prior to this, they used a site made on Blogger that structured everything as a news feed without any navigation and awkward formatting. The primary information for the website (contact info, hours, and copy) was formatted together as a photo and plugged in as a blog post, making it unnavigable to screen readers as well as search engine optimization crawlers. If you clicked the phone number as a shortcut to call the establishment or even to copy the number, it would simply enlarge the photo. From a pure aesthetic perspective, I loved it! It had quirky, do-it-yourself charm and an authentic old-school feel. However, it was long past due for an update.

## UX Objectives / UI Solutions

The user experience was designed in consideration of two customers in mind: first-time visitors whom we'd like to convert and repeat guests who want as little friction in booking an appointment as possible.

- Mobile-first approach to design:
    1. Hamburger nav menu with easing transitions & opaque background while blurring the site behind it out of focus.
    2. Photos chosen and elements hidden or shown depending on the size of the browser.
    3. Employment of various techniques to minimize dependency on media queries for less rigid device support such as: flex, grid, wrap, picture elements, clamp, relative sizing units.
    4. Phone number and address offer to call and open google maps to the destination respectively.
- "**BOOK**" button is given as much prominence as possible: bold, upper-cased, framed, and fixed to the upper-right hand corner to accommodate most users' dominant hand.
- Initial viewport when landing on the home page includes only the most pertinent information with hero image sized to occupy all remaining real estate.
- Guests perusing can scroll to navigate or click the hyperlinks to learn more.
- Navigation bar with fixed position as the user scrolls through the site.
- Numerous external links to the business's appointment booking platform to direct customer to point of sale.
- Aesthetics and animations were balanced to prioritize legibility, offer some modernity while not detracting from DIY and heritage story of the establishment.

### Accessibility

I'm always eager to learn more how to improve the accessibility for all users, so any feedback is appreciated. These are some of the considerations I've included so far:

- Aria controls on the navigation bar
- Screen-reader only elements
- Descriptive alt tags
- Zoom-enabled fonts
